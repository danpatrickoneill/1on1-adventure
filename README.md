# 1on1-adventure
A (mostly) text-based basketball adventure, with some light strategy and RPG elements.

- Player progression (through winning games? Training? Who knows!)
- Gameplay elements first; balancing/tuning later
- Various opponents, increasing in difficulty
- Name your player whatever you want!
- Persistent player data for those who want it
- Ability to choose offensive + defensive play style, possibly on the fly; simple toggle in both cases, or can it be stepped up to an RPS level?
- 4-6 attrs to start: perimeter/post D, outside(3, midrange), inside(layup, dunk)

## Player control
- How should it be set up? Players don't need a strategic preference set all the time, so maybe it could just be done through the match.
- But it might make sense to choose a style of player? That's a nice idea.
- In the immediate term, I think this makes the most sense; style can dictate offensive approach, and you can set a defensive strategy (maybe not even in v1)
- I think offensive tendency should dictate shot distribution, maybe including a skill bump to relevant skills on character creation
- Question is; should defensive strategy affect shot distribution as well?
- Will definitely affect shot success; maybe only affects distribution at higher levels, could be sort of Perks-like

## Match System
- Needs method of assigning possession at the start of match; probably shoot for it, right?
- Need to play out each point, give a result; for now, let's say all misses are defensive rebounds; airball and back up mechanic could be fun (penalize shaky three point shooters being given space to shoot)
- Easy to set up different possession rules on made basket
- Some sort of 21 game? Would like to try a text-based/maybe eventually visual FT component
- Static styles for now; think notes on mechanics from above section still hold true
- Mix up displayed results as needed; steals, blocks, what have you
- But are those actual differences, or does it not really matter with skills being what they are? Probably keep it simple to start
