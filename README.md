# 1on1-adventure
A (mostly) text-based basketball adventure, with some light strategy and RPG elements.

- Player progression (through winning games? Training? Who knows!)
- Gameplay elements first; balancing/tuning later
- Various opponents, increasing in difficulty
- Name your player whatever you want!
- Persistent player data for those who want it
- Ability to choose offensive + defensive play style, possibly on the fly; simple toggle in both cases, or can it be stepped up to an RPS level?
- 4-6 attrs to start: perimeter/post D, outside(3, midrange), inside(layup, dunk)

## Player control
- How should it be set up? Players don't need a strategic preference set all the time, so maybe it could just be done through the match.
- But it might make sense to choose a style of player? That's a nice idea.
